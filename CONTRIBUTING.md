## Contribute a Change

### Commit Messages

* Commit messages should include a short (72 chars or less) title summarizing the change.
* They should also include a body with more detailed explanatory text, wrapped to 72 characters.
  * The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely).
* Commit messages should be written in the imperative: "Implement feature" and not "Implemented feature".
* Bulleted points are fine.
* Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a single space.
