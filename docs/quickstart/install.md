# Installing the Tanzu CLI

The Tanzu CLI can be installed either from pre-built binary releases from
its GitHub project, or via popular package managers like Homebrew, apt and yum/dnf.

## From the Binary Releases in the GitHub project

Every [release](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-cli/releases) of the
Tanzu CLI provides separate binary releases for a variety of OS's and machine
architectures. You only need to install the CLI itself. Note that the other
assets present in each release provide access to the administrative plugins;
however, the CLI can install these plugins directly without having to manually
download these particular assets, which are only provided for convenience.

1. Download the [desired version](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-cli/releases). We recommend picking the latest release of the major version of the CLI you want to use.  You should choose the asset of the form `tanzu-cli-OS-ARCH.tar.gz`.
2. Unpack it (e.g. `tar -zxvf tanzu-cli-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`)
3. Find the `tanzu` binary in the unpacked directory, move it to its desired location in your $PATH
   destination (`mv v0.90.0/tanzu-cli-darwin_amd64 /usr/local/bin/tanzu`), provide it executable permission (`chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/tanzu`) if necessary.
4. Verify the correct version of CLI is properly installed: `tanzu version`

## Via Package Managers
