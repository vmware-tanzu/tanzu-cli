# Tanzu CLI Project Roadmap

## About this document

This document provides a link to the Tanzu CLI Project
[Issues list](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-cli/issues) that serves
as the up to date description of items that are in the Tanzu CLI release
pipeline. Most items are gathered from the community or include a feedback loop
with the community. This should serve as a reference point for Tanzu CLI users
and contributors to understand where the project is heading, and help determine
if a contribution could be conflicting with a longer term plan.

## How to help?

Discussion on the roadmap can take place in threads under
[Issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-cli/issues). We currently
do not hold Community Meetings; however we plan to in the future. Please open
and comment on an issue if you want to provide suggestions and feedback to an
item in the roadmap. Please review the roadmap to avoid potential duplicated
effort.

## How to add an item to the roadmap?

Please open an issue to track any initiative on the roadmap of Tanzu CLI
(usually driven by new feature requests). We will work with and rely on our
community to focus our efforts to improve Tanzu CLI.

## Current Roadmap

The following table includes the current roadmap for Tanzu CLI. If you have any
questions or would like to contribute to Tanzu CLI, please contact the team
directly to discuss with our team. If you don't know where to start, we are
always looking for contributors that will help us reduce technical, automation,
and documentation debt. Please take the timelines & dates as proposals and
goals. Priorities and requirements change based on community feedback,
roadblocks encountered, community contributions, etc. If you depend on a
specific item, we encourage you to help us deliver that feature by contributing
to Tanzu CLI.
