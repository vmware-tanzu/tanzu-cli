// value.
// If a developer has a beta feature they want to expose, but leave turned off by default, they should create
// an entry here with a false value. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND the use of a SEPARATE flag for beta use; one that ends in "-beta".
// Thus, if you plan to eventually release a feature with a flag named "features.global.foo-bar", you should consider
// releasing the beta version with "features.global.foo-bar-beta". This will make it much easier when it comes time for
// mainstreaming the feature (with a default true value) under the flag name "features.global.foo-bar", as there will be
// no conflict with previous installs (that have a false value for the entry "features.global.foo-bar-beta").
